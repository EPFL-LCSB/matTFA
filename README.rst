matTFA
=======

Requirements
------------

You will need to have `Git-LFS <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_ in order to properly download .mat files.

The scripts have been developed with Matlab 2012a, and CPLEX 12.5 (freely downloadable with the `IBM Academic initiative <https://developer.ibm.com/academic/>`_), and successfully ran on several other versions of both softwares. However, it is important to respect the IBM compatibility specs sheets between Matlab, CPLEX, and the computer OS - available `on IBM's website <https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html>`_

We recommend the stable combination of MATLAB 2016a and CPLEX 12.7 (also freely downloadable from the IBM Academic initiative).
